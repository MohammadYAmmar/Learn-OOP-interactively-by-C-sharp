# Learn OOP interactively by C#
The idea of the program is to learn Object-oriented programming interactively and at the same time you can see the files and link between them and relationships interactively, the plan for a project contains many advantages, but still in the initial development stage, to follow the program in the latest version.

The reason for this project to prove information while learning to program with objects in an advanced and applied way to some new principles for me, in addition to informing new learners that the program has reached the stage of stability version.
# Main interface

The program interacts with the user who wants to learn OOP

The main interface of the program, It is possible to enter a name, type, and interface for the object, and all this is realistically done in the project if you want to access the files.

An example of the work of an object for a Tesla car, and we note the automatic adjustment of the menus.

Laptop example, with the test button to make sure if Python installed on the device for the features that I want to add later

# Future work

In the future, more interaction with the user for examples with the possibility of modifying the properties and experimenting with them in a practical way, adding Python to a simple interactive interface that works as a maze to convey the reach, adding particles to the quiz to consolidate the information with the learner.

# Tasks 
I've been breaking down tasks while working in the main code and this is what I've achieved for now
