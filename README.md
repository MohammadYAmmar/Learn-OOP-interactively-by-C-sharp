# Learn OOP interactively by C#
The idea of the program is to learn Object-oriented programming interactively and at the same time you can see the files and link between them and relationships interactively, the plan for a project contains many advantages, but still in the initial development stage, to follow the program in the latest version.

# Main interface

The main interface of the program, It is possible to enter a name, type, and interface for the object, and all this is realistically done in the project if you want to access the files.
